# SoftwareArchitecture - ChatBot integrated with Llama2

Trello board https://trello.com/b/hwGXrUpZ/red-hot-chili-paprika

In this project, we were asked to improve the user experience during the
Street Science days in L’Aquila. The goal is to expand the capabilities of
the NdR Mobile App, specifically its architecture, to incorporate a chatbot
enabling the user to request one or multiple services from the app incorporat-
ing essential components to enable the utilization of Large Language Models
(LLMs). These LLMs serve as a mechanism to derive user goals from a given
natural language text of a users. Using LLMs, we identify user intentions
and parse them into appropriate grammatical structures, and further make
use of goal modeling mechanisms to identify the functionalities required to
accomplish the user goal. The goal of the Ndr application is to allow users
to access events, locate parking spaces and easily navigate the city, as well
as enable better crowd management and improve the quality of the visit ex-
perience using its microservices-based architecture. Our component serves
as an extension of the current application, which focuses on identifying user
intentions and using them to change the application’s behavior adaptively.
By incorporating user objectives identified through natural language models,
we aim to refine the capabilities of the application and optimize the visitor
experience by allowing them to access the services offered during the Street
Science days in an easier and more intuitive way, through use of a UI to
exchange messages with the language model.
